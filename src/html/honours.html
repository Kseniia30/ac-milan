            Milan is one of the most successful clubs in Italy, having won a total of 31 domestic honours, in addition
            international successes. Milan has earned the right to place a star on its jersey in recognition of the fact
            that it has won at least ten scudetti. In addition, the club is permanently allowed to display a
            multiple-winner badge on its shirt as it has won more than five European Cups.
